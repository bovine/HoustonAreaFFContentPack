# Houston Area Content Pack for ForeFlight

This content pack contains helpful data for Houston Area general
aviation pilots.

## Installation

To install this content pack into your ForeFlight application, use Safari click each of these links
on your iPad device and choose to open with ForeFlight:

* https://foreflight.com/content?downloadURL=https://github.com/bovine/HoustonAreaFFContentPack/archive/dev.zip

If prompted to import as waypoints or a map layer, choose map layer.

Then in the Map Layers dropdown menu of ForeFlight, you should now have two new options for "practice-areas" and "restaurants".

## Google Earth

The two KML links above can also be opened in Google Earth Pro on your Mac/PC computer.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Please expand this content pack with useful
information for your Houston Area airport. Please check the guidelines before
contributing, though.

### Guidelines

* Location must be in the Houston Area or immediate surrounding area,
  to prevent data overload.
* Data must be relevant to most general aviation pilots (VFR or IFR): no company
  procedures, military stuff, etc.
* Data must be relevant to air navigation: practice areas, cool
  airport restaurants, etc.
