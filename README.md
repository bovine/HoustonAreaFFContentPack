aviation pilots.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Please expand this content pack with useful
information for your Houston Area airport. Please check the guidelines before
contributing, though.

### Guidelines

* Location must be in the Houston Area or immediate surrounding area,
  to prevent data overload.
* Data must be relevant to most general aviation pilots (VFR or IFR): no company
  procedures, military stuff, etc.
* Data must be relevant to air navigation: practice areas, cool
  airport restaurants, etc.
