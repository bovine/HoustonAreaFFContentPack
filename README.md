### Guidelines

* Location must be in the Houston Area or immediate surrounding area,
  to prevent data overload.
* Data must be relevant to most general aviation pilots (VFR or IFR): no company
  procedures, military stuff, etc.
* Data must be relevant to air navigation: practice areas, cool
  airport restaurants, etc.
